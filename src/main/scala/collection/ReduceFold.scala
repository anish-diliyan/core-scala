package collection

/*
 * You cannot use reduce on an empty collection. You will get an exception if you do,
 * so make sure your collection is not empty before you pass it to reduce.
 * Scala provides an alternative, reduceOption, that does not throw an exception,
 * but represents the result as an Option.
 */
/*
 * fold takes a binary operation just as reduce does, but it also takes a starting value
 * in addition to the collection. That is how fold can handle empty collections.
 * If the collection is empty, youâ€™re just left with the starting value.
